This project follows the MVC architecture with MenuModel class as the model component, MenuController class as the 
controller component, and MenuGUI class as the view component. This architecture manages the orders. (write the relationships
between them from notebook and make the diagram)
The credit cards are managed by a super class CreditCard with subclasses of different types of cards. This is an extensible
form of pattern, because to add a new form a payment, the coder will have to add a new subclass and extend CreditCard class.

Pros of this architecture: This kind of architecture is good, because this makes sure that the user doesn't directly manipulate
the model. The user makes changes in the view, and to make that change in the model, the command has to go through the 
controller. Also, if a new frame is needed, it can be fitted in without making many changes to the pattern. View and controller
are pluggable. 

Cons: The complexity of the application making increases. Making connections between view and controller can be hard. Loose
coupling is usually preferred, but in this there is close coupling of view and controller to the model.

Short description of classes:
MenuController: This class communicates between the model and view components. It uses the input file of menu to render the 
menu buttons. The view component sends a request according to which this class manipulates the model component.

MenuGUI: This class is the GUI of the project. The user interacts with this class to make an order. This class sends requests 
or actions according to the user to the controller class to make changes to the model. This class actually (indirectly through
controller) displays the model. This class also uses CreditCard subclasses to validate the transaction. 

MenuModel: This class is the model component. This class manages the items and their prices. 

CreditCard: This is a super class that generalizes all the payment cards. It takes in a number and the type of the card.
All payment card classes extend this class. This is a way of making the design extensible.

AmericanExpress: This is a payment card class that extends CreditCard class. According to the specifications of this card, 
it validates the card.   

Discover: This is a payment card class that extends CreditCard class. According to the specifications of this card, 
it validates the card. 

Master: This is a payment card class that extends CreditCard class. According to the specifications of this card, 
it validates the card. 

Visa: This is a payment card class that extends CreditCard class. According to the specifications of this card, 
it validates the card.
